# Gradient-Descent-Logistic-Regression-from-Scratch
This is a implementation of Gradient Descent using Logistic Regression from Scratch for Predictions. 

Gradient Descent is a first order iterative optimization algorithm fro finding the minimum of a function. Gradient descent is also known as steepest descent.

Data could be manipulated in the "main.py" file and the same file could be run for Predictions.
